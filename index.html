            Penn, thrill seeker, optimist, and an all around joyful person. I grew up in Shreveport, LA
            with two amazing parents and an ok sister(just kidding she's pretty awesome). My love for computers started
            at a very young age but was never fully pursued until much later in life. However, I feel like it's never
            too late to follow up on your passions you have to put on hold from time to time.</p>


        <p>
            My career started where everyone's started in highschool. My first job was working as a cashier at a local
            water park called Watertown USA(it has since shutdown and is now owned by Splash Mountain). The very next
            summer I would become a manager of food services at the ripe old age of 16. I recieved my next job at Krispy
            Kreme Doughnuts(which comically I am now working for again just at a different location) at the age 17. I
            graduated from Captain Shreve Highschool in 2010 at the age of 17 and decided not to wait until I was 18 to
            join the Marine Corps(cause when you want something why wait?!?!?). So I ended up leaving for basic less
            than a month after my graduation. After all of my initial training was completed (bootcamp,MCT, MOS School)
            I finally arrived at MCAS Miramar at the begininng of 2011. By the ending of 2012 I had been accepted as a
            Marine Embassy Security Guard(MSG for short) and I got to my first post in Capetown, South Africa. My second
            post took me to Paris, France and the third to Erbil, Iraq.
        </p>

        <p> I got out of the Corps back in 2016 and I've enjoyed my time taking on many different
            jobs! I've been able to become a cop, waiter, uber driver, truck driver, real estate agent, and even a car
            salesman. So I've gotten a little taste of everything. However, I feel that now is finally the time to
            pursue a career that I've dreamed about since childhood in the wonderful world of computers. To be
            completely honest I had no idea where to start. I just knew that I wanted a job around computers and people
            who love them as much as I do.
